I ran split_data.py on 1203
on submissions, with if statement to account for xz and gz2
got nohup.out-1203 from that
there are 12 files
not sure what happened. maybe didn't get all data?
it said it reached the end of a compressed file before someting happend...
maybe it got everything???

day befor did same thing with 
spli_data.py on 1202 on coments without xz and gz if statement
I didn't get decemebr as a result because decemebr 2017 was saved as xz

1204
running split_data.py on 'redo' test file which is just dec 2017
