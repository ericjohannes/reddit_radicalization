am working to count posts with hate words
i'm just counting posts if they contain one hateword
1. because it's faster
2. it's a reasonable measure of hatespeech use, the number or fraction of
posts containing a hatespeech term
3. tokenizing is hard. 

running into a problem: short "hatespeech" terms pop up often
if I don't tokenize

i'll look at the list to se how common this might be

I'm going to tokenize the body of the post

I also went through listof terms
cut out ones with spaces
first, I can't use those if I tokenize the body of the post
most of those are redundant because one of the terms is on its own too
I added 'fag' which wasn't in there. faggy and faggot were
seemed obviousS
saving as hatebase_vocab_woinnocent_eng_ebedits.csv
there are 704 terms now


>>>test_hate(post_dict, terms_list)
'ho'

going to run my code
it seems to work
nohup python3 count_hatespeech.py

doesn't work
there is no body key in submissions, there is self text
made it so submissions use 'selftext' not 'body'
that should work...
also added error handling for key errors in case for some reason 
the keys I use don't work, the program doesn't break
instead, it prints an error

it all executed
results in nohup.out look correcct
problem is no hatespeech was found
i'll try it with a test list
